This code is inteded to perform a registration between a 2D contour and a 3D
surface. The 2D contour is extracted from a 2D image, and the 3D surface is
encoded as a 3D volume with a distance map to the surface.

The driving scenario for this registration is the alignment of 2D mouse brain
slices with a 3D atlas.
